    <p className="text-sm text-justify">
      Food is a basic human right, yet millions of people around the world, including right here in our own
      communities, struggle to put enough food on the table. Hunger is not just a physical needâ€”it impacts mental
      well-being, education, and productivity.
      <br />
      <br />
      By providing food to those in need, we aim to not only alleviate hunger but also empower individuals and
      families to lead healthier, happier lives. Our work is grounded in the belief that every person deserves
      dignity, respect, and the chance to thrive.
